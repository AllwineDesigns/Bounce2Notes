Bounce is a game which captivates children of all ages. Balls bounce around the screen making musical notes as they collide with other balls. Try the paid version of Bounce to get more colors and more sounds! Bounce is fully multitouch enabled so multiple people can interact with the simulation at the same time. Users interact with the simulation by tilting the device, tapping, flicking and dragging (flicking and dragging are in the paid version only).

Controls:
Tap on empty space to create a ball of random size.
Flick on empty space to shoot a ball in the direction of the flick. (paid version only)
Drag on empty space to create a ball of any size. (paid version only)

Tap on a ball to delete it.
